       " 'This was a very nice place and I can honestly say that the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in The location is good in that it is right of the U2 subway line which connects to everything in Vienna so even though you are not centrally located you feel centrally located and can access important hotspots easily One drawback was that we somehow blew a circuit cutting off the power to the living room and since we had difficulty emailing or Hidden by Airbnb ing without an internet connection as that was cut off as well it took us a day to contact the hosts and caused us a little stress as we both needed the internet for work items Margarita was very nice and apologetic about this situation though and responded promptly once we emailed her I would just recommend to ask maybe what you should do if that happens to you maybe there is a breaker switch that can be turned on or off as we werent doing anything out of the ordinary All in all it was a great stay and we enjoyed our time in Vienna ',\n",
