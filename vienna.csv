It was hot when we stayed so we kept the windows open which did allow some traffic, train and street noise to drift in during the rush hour (which starts early in Vienna!) but the windows are effective at cutting out all noise when closed.  The apartment is as beautifully and stylishly furnished as the images show, with a focus on Ikea (appropriately enough for a Swedish owner!).  The bedrooms are small but adequate for a holiday. The laptop and mobiles were a marvellous extra touch.  Ingela took trouble to come over to meet us.  Her folder of local recommendations and ideas for the holiday was an absolute treasure.  The walk up the steps to the apartment was a great way to lose some of the weight that we put on eating at the restaurants she recommended (and there is a lift for carrying up luggage or heavy shopping)! The nearby Renaissance Hotel was a useful resource - they provided the Vienna cards that we bought which provided free public transport and discounts at restaurants, museums, shops etc.  There were shops, banks and restaurants within a short stroll of the apartment.

She made arrangements for ride from the airport at a very good rate, and then again to the train station. Her apartment is very close to the U4 station; U4 line takes you right to the old town. It is also a station away from The Schonbrunn Palace. So very well located, slightly away from the busy touristy area, yet quick enough to get there.. Ingela was a very welcoming, helpful host. Her apartment was exactly as pictured. She provided us with written instructions on how to get into the apartment if she was wasn't there when we got there. She got there five minutes after we arrived, and gave us good orientation of her apartment, and the amenities. She had two cell phones available for use, which was a nice touch, not that we used it but we did carry with us for couple of days in case we needed to get hold of her to get around the city. Upon arrival at her apartment she had a binder with lots of helpful information for nearby cafes, markets, restaurants etc. The apartment basically had everything you would want. Ingela was very helpful and responded promptly before and during our stay, to any questions and concerns that we had. She came by for a visit on our last night to say goodbye. This was our first airbnb experience and we felt very comfortable at her apartment.","Near Palace Schönbrunn, Apt. 1",175131,Ingela,Rudolfsheim-Fnfhaus,48.18434,16.32701,Entire home/apt,156,1,162,01-11-2021,1.17,15,306,7,en

I'm going to break down the review for ease. <br/>The Good : The apartment looks exactly like the pictures. So it's pretty nice.  Ingela is very nice and helpful. When the elevator didn't work - she gave us options of apartments at the ground floor. Those apartments weren't really as nice as this one - but at least she gave us an option. This apartment has everything you'd ever need. The procedure to collect and return keys was fairly simple and convenient. <br/>The Bad: The apartment isn't exactly accessible by an elevator. The elevator reaches the 4th floor and the apartment is on the third so you'll have to climb up and down. May not be a very good idea if you have elderly parents. The elevator was broken down during our stay - so access was highly uncomfortable for my parents. The building is a bit run down and doesn't look all that welcoming. <br/><br/>Overall - Good location, Not so good building but a good apartment. The host is really really nice and is available to solve any issue you may have.

The pictures of the apartment were spot-on for how bright, clean and functional it was for us. She also assisted us in arranging taxis for both arrival and departure, which was a great help. The cab company was reliable and presented on time, also.  The apartment was impeccably clean! There was coffee and tea provided to start out the week. We needed umbrellas one day: there were umbrellas! There was work being done on the building's interior windows, and though we weren't home for most of that (during the day), we were made aware of that work being done and the workers were cordial. (And the new interior windows will be terrific!) This was our first experience with Airbnb as well as our first European trip, and we were pleased with how it all worked out. It truly felt like we had a little home for the week. The only downturn (which has nothing to do with our host) was that it was a little farther from our daughter's dorm residence than we anticipated, but we were very close to the Ubonn station and quickly learned how to navigate to meet her. We are grateful that we had such a wonderful experience and felt the warmth of Ingela's hospitality and concern for our experience. I would highly recommend this listing and this host.

He allowed us to change the booking name,  waited for us when our train was delayed and showed us around his apartment, giving us lots of top tips on what to do and where to eat in Vienna. His communication was top notch and he left a little information guide, personal to our stay, which held everything we needed. If you want to feel welcomed then Hannes will certainly do so. <br/><br/>As for the apartment itself, there are two double beds (one sofa bed and one bunk bed above the bathroom) and a kitchen with hobs, a sink, kettle and lots of kitchen utensils. There is a dining table inside for 2 people and outside there is a table and 4 chairs. It is structured as a series of apartments looking inwards so you can sit outside on the terrace in the evening with a glass of wine. Hannes provides all the things you need and more. We had access to his bikes to cycle along the Danube cycle path and his guide books for Vienna which we used to do walking tours of Vienna. We even got a fan which was a huge change to the hotels we'd been staying in the previous weeks when there was no air con despite the heatwave!<br/><br/>The apartment is located just round the corner from Karmelitermarkt which is a market with lots of cafes. We went for breakfast here. Then it's about a 15 minute walk over the river and into town to get to the centre at Stephensplatz. There is a SPAR nearby (I think on HollandstraBe) which is good for getting groceries. I would recommend using the Rick Steves guidebook to do a walking tour of Vienna then use the bikes to cycle round the old city walls and then along the Danube cycle path. If you want a good view of the city and a smashing cocktail then go up to the top floor bar of the Sofitel hotel. The cocktails are around 15 Euros but are very good quality and you get an outstanding view that you'd pay to get to the top of the cathedral in town. <br/><br/>Overall we had a lovely stay and can't thank Hannes enough for his hospitality.

Otherwise, make sure to get a security deposit or do not rent. I already receive a review stating that I left a host's apt tidy. Again, Diana was there for my questions or concerns.

I also love the apartment's decor. Very nicely done! My favorite was the beautifully deigned bathroom. It offered a relaxing and safe atmosphere after a busy day and all in the heart of Vienna.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm giving the apartment 4/5 was because of a smell from the courtyard on the ground floor. There was a faint smell of trash. Unfortunately, opening up the front windows (Living room areas) can make things a bit noisy. Opening up the courtyard windows (foyer, bedroom and bathroom areas) allowed for fresh air without hearing any street traffic - unfortunately, a less than desired smell from the courtyard lead to the lower rating.

However, this apartment seemed lovely so we decided to give it a try and I am very glad we did. <br/><br/>This apartment is even nicer in real life than the pictures. It is simply a beautiful place, very spacious, high ceilings, modernly furnished, immaculately clean, equiped with everything you may need on a trip and very conveniently located close to a lot of attractions in the centre of the beautiful City of Vienna. The bathroom and shower have heated floors which are just lovely in the winter. The hosts are a married couple who live in the apartment right next door. The husband waited for us to let us in and show us around on the day of our arrival. Although we arrived before check-in time, we were able to drop our luggage while the place was being cleaned after the previous visitors. The hosts are ready to extend a helping hand and respond immediately to any concerns. <br/><br/>The two minor glitches we experienced are the coffee machine was hard to use, it worked perfectly sometimes and then would just produce brackish dilute coffee other times. Not at all a big deal as there are lots of coffee shops all over the city.<br/><br/>The other mishap was relating to the elevator. There is an elevator in the building however, it does not service the first floor on which this apartment is located, not sure why. After having dragged our suitcases up, the host told us that we can use it to send our luggage down on our departure, but we had to make sure the internal door in the elevator closes properly. On the morning of our departure and as the cab taking us to the airport was waiting outside, the elevator door wouldn't open locking our suitcases inside it. The host called the elevator service company right away who came to rescue our suitcases. Thankfully we had left enough time to make it to the airport. Unfortunately, the first cab company that couldn't wait for us charged us anyway. So we had to pay twice for a trip to the airport. Not the best way to start a morning or a trip, but at least we made our flight!<br/><br/>Despite this, we had a great time in Vienna and really enjoyed staying here. I would highly recommend this apartment and its hosts. They simply care about your experience at their place and about keeping the place in an excellent condition.

The building is a lovely old Viennese apartment building but the apartment fittings, bathrooms, kitchen appliances, are brand new. Hallways are all clean well lit and safe.

Lots of small grocery stores, specialty shops, coffee shops and ethnic restaurants. Very convenient and 100% walkable. <br/>If you have a car put it in one of the nearby garages there are lots of them. <br/>The Indian restaurant next door is very good and inexpensive. <br/>You have to climb only one flight of stairs to the apartment and the elevator does not work. <br/>There were three adults in our group.

I WISH I COULD TAKE THEM HOME TO NEW ZEALAND WITH ME.<br/><br/>THESE ARE THE BEST AND I COULDN'T RATE THEM MORE HIGHLY.<br/><br/>After an epic train journey from Prague, a journey that should have taken 4 hours, we had train breakdowns, buses,  trains with standing room only, we finally got to Vienna 10 1/2 hours later. Took a taxi to our apartment and we found a very amazing, smiling Ingela who was so concerned for us. We were so apologetic and it was in the late evening, but Ingela made us so welcome and at ease and pleased we were safe.  What a wonderful welcome we had after such a stressful day. A bowl of fruit and chocolate was on the coffee table awaited us.  Coffee, breakfast selections on the kitchen.  The bed is extremely COMFORTABE, as are the couches.<br/><br/>Ingela''s apartments are ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, BEAUTIFULLY FURNISHED, COMFORTABLE, EVERYTHING ONE COULD WANT.  INGELA HAD NOT OVERLOOKED ANYTHING RIGHT DOWN TO A FIRST AID KIT AND A SMALL TORCH ON THE DOOR KEYS. THE INTERIOR DECORATING, COLOUR SCHEMES, FURNITURE QUALITY KITCHENWARE, OH, I COULD GO ON ON AND.<br/><br/>Ingela has cells phone for your use, a laptop, wifi, many tourist documents, written information and a map to assist you in the local area, trains, help contacts such as doctors.  She hasn't missed a thing. <br/><br/>The Palace was a 10 min walk away. We took the Grand tour and spent the afternoon wandering in the palace gardens.  The Grand tour, palace and its history is amazing. Next day we took a taxi to the Spanish Riding School. - fabulous, but be there an hour early or book tickets on line.  The Hundertwasser's museum and village is a must. Take a taxi from the riding school to the museum which has an amazing cafe.  If you don't know the bus and train system, then this is the best way to get around. While in the taxi you also get a good view of Vienna.<br/><br/>INGELA'S apartments are very central to the city and transport by train and bus.<br/><br/>Do take the opportunity to stay here and enjoy your visit to Vienna in style and comfort. <br/><br/>","Near Palace Schönbrunn, Apt. 5",175131,Ingela,Rudolfsheim-Fnfhaus,48.18445,16.32722,Entire home/apt,82,1,120,04-01-2020,0.94,15,365,0,en

Although the we briefly met Andrei, he was the epitome of what a Viennese citizen would represent, warm, kind, and so helpful. His place is equipped with everything you would need while on vacation. All I needed was a cat, and it would be complete. His vast array of eclectic music CD's was amazing. His apartment is spot on when it comes to traveling all over Vienna. The tram is just around the corner and the main train station is just a 3 minute walk from his apartment. There is a major grocery store around the corner and lots of quaint restaurants within walking distance. If you want to visit the worlds oldest Merry go round, it's a whopping 5 minute walk to the Prater-an  enormous park. Not too shabby. You want to rent a bike?, stations are everywhere in Vienna, and 3 minute walk from the apt. The apartment is off a main road, but extremely quiet. All in all, we were very pleased with Andrei's apt. He kept in touch with us for weeks before and up to the day of our arrival and had all the vital information we needed for emergencies and sights to explore (by rating) in a neat organized binder.

Some previous reviews touched on issues with the number of rooms - I encountered the same thing, but all it was is ensuring you choose the correct number of visitors when you book, as the price is slightly higher for 2 rooms instead of 1. There were some small language issues understanding this and working out how to change the booking on Airbnb, but it was quickly and politely resolved and the price was still very reasonable compared to other places I have stayed in Vienna.

Ingela provides very clear instructions on how to get in that you will not have any problem at all. The apartment is exactly as it is in the pictures: cozy, clean, comfortable, complete, and excellently-located. And all the rave reviews are true. Ingela has a gift for details; in the apartment, you will find everything you need—including a 'white bible': an incredibly useful and detailed compilation of Ingela's tips, maps, recommended restos, groceries, cafes, shops and attractions. Follow it! We did, and it made our Vienna experience richer and more local. Ingela is indeed a warm, thoughtful, and responsive host; we were truly delighted to have met her during our stay. You will find that she has welcome chocolates and fruit, and has kitted out the apartment with a TV, CD, DVD player, CDs, books, all the kitchen essentials and toiletries. The U-bahn is a 3-minute walk; we were in the city centre in 10 minutes; going back was easy-peasy, no stress. The apartment was perfect for relaxing after a tiring day of touring Vienna. We were comfortable walking around in the neighborhood, even late at night. We also found it convenient that Palace Schonbrunn is just a 15-minute walk away and it IS a must-see. We went there twice for the interiors and the gardens. As the neighborhood is quiet and the bed comfy, we slept very well each night. We had an early flight on our last day, and Ingela very kindly helped us book a taxi. As with everything in this apartment, this took off a lot of stress; such a huge help, really.

Ingela is the kind of person who should give workshops on how to set up a place so that it is hospitable and so the person visiting is instantly at ease.  I was so impressed with her attention to detail and thoughtfulness that ranged from sweet and thoughtful (fruit & chocolate basket; heat turned on before you arrive so you walk into a toasty apartment; a charged/charging mobile phone with prepaid minutes ready to use for local calls!) to the practical (toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent and softener, house slippers, shower gel and shampoo in the bathroom, kitchen stocked with everything you might possibly need: tin foil, cling film, toaster, loads of utensils, good knives, cheese grater, electric mixer range of glassware and cookware; and a wonderful binder full of suggestions, critical information, maps and tips etc).  Ingela is the type of person who should be in this 'business' because she clearly doesn't view it just as a profit-making 'business', she cares about making each visitor's visit to Vienna wonderful and memorable.  There is such a warmth to what she does and how she does it.  She has multiple properties in the same building so I would encourage large parties to take advantage of this!  The location is fantastic, steps away from the U4 from which you can easily get into Stephenplatz, Karlsplatz, any museum or shopping street.

And I had gotten no heads up on whether there would be another person checking in during my stay. <br/><br/>I had specifically searched for properties listed under the type of ""Entire home"" as I did not want to share the airbnb with people that I do not know.<br/><br/>Had I been aware that this place was actually 2 rooms (one master bedroom and another bedroom + regular bathroom) that were separtely rented out and in which I had to share the front door with someone, I would have simply chosen the option of ""Private room"" and chosen a similar priced but fancier options that comes with shared but proper kitchens & living room.<br/><br/>When I called Dan 2 times and tried to explain to him multiple times that I think this is clear dishonesty/ false information on his side to list this property as an ""Entire Home"" he simply kept on repeating the below in a very rude manner.<br/><br/>1. The place provides me with a room and a non-shared bathroom therefore it is an entire home.<br/><br/>2. He has never had a person have an issue with this during the past 10 years.<br/><br/>I called the airbnb customer services and they told me that in fact this is wrong of him to post such property under ""Entire home"" and that they've now made it very clear to him to change the type of property in this listing.

We flew in, caught a train to the Hauptbahnhof, switched to a subway, and popped up onto Marianhilfestrasse and with the building almost in sight. So, getting there was pretty straight forward. <br/><br/>There was a lift to get suitcases up the worst of the stairs. The apartment was cleaned to the most discriminating standards and very comfortable. <br/><br/>Best of all-- it was within walking distance of almost all the big Vienna sights. And the U-Bahn was, as I said, a mere block away. We enjoyed the Christkindlmarkts that were scattered all about the city and truly were enchanted by the Viennese and their beautiful city.<br/><br/>Also, Stephan was very attentive to us as incoming guests; he answered all of our questions, and make every effort to make sure we were comfortable with our arrival and access to the flat. He was away himself at the time we were in Vienna, so he made sure we had contacts for people if there were problems and ensured us that if there were any issues (which there weren't) there would be some help for us without delay. <br/><br/>I highly recommend staying in this flat if you're visiting Vienna and want a no-frills, cost-efficient, clean, convenient place to stay and don't need all the amenities of a hotel.

Il quartiere e` pieno di locali, quindi la sera si può restare li o tornare in centro in meno di 15 minuti a piedi. L'unica cosa che non e' andata benissimo riguarda il bagaglio: purtroppo non c'e` uno stanzino o un posto vicino dove lasciarlo e, quindi, se come noi avrete un volo/treno alla sera tardi e volete godervi la giornata, questo potrebbe essere l'unico problema. Stefan ci aveva consigliato in anticipo di lasciare i bagagli in una stazione vicina, dato che non fornisce questo servizio (lo sapevamo già), ma purtroppo trovare armadietti liberi non e' stato facile, o erano occupati o fuori uso... questo ci ha obbligati a fare il giro di varie stazioni alla ricerca di un armadietto, perdendo un paio d'ore che avremmo preferito dedicare alla citta`.

Dan is a wonderful host and very responsive to our messages, questions, and issues. Kitchen was well stocked and there is a large bathroom with a separate toilet area. There were 5 of us and we stayed for a week. <br/><br/>Some cons during our stay....<br/><br/>The room was not ready when we arrived at 7:30-8pm. Dan was very apologetic and it was semi-finished after we arrived. The room also did not really match the photos provided on the listing- not sure if it’s a different space or just redecorated since the listing was made. Furniture wasn’t totally the same and wall colors were totally different.<br/><br/>We had 5 people and the sleeping situation was not ideal. To note, there are not 5 separate beds. There are 3 beds: a nice double bed, a futon (which sleeps 2 tightly and is very firm) and a single, thin mattress pad that was balanced on a folded out ottoman. The ottoman had a large stain. I did not sleep well the first night because it was not sturdy. The single mattress did not have a fitted sheet either at first and that was also stained. <br/><br/>We were not sleeping well the first two nights and requested another single bed or air stress. Dan quickly brought a very nice and thick single mattress that saved the trip. We ended up having one smaller person sleep on the couch, one on the futon with the original single mattress to help with the firmness, 2 in the nice double bed, and one on the floor with the thick mattress. Dan was more than willing to help with everything, but the original sleeping situation was not ideal for 5 adults.  <br/><br/>In addition, the bathroom does not have more than a generic liquid soap so bring shampoo/conditioner and any sort of lotion you need. The washer also requires some detergent, which we brought to use. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the location, large space, and Dan’s willingness to help was the best part of our stay.

2154,235805,7617675,27-09-2013,2530254,Doron,"The Dorotheum apartment, at Dorotheergasse no. 22, is located in the heart of Vienna. For a visitor to Vienna, first time or returning, this is an ideal location. Between two clusters of major tourist and city life attractions, the apartment is about half-way between the Hofburg at one end and the Albertina/Hotel Sacher/Wiener Staatsoper hub at the other end. Yet, being located on a smaller street and away from the major street linking the mentioned two focuses of activity, the apartment offers peace and quiet, retired as it is from the hustle and bustle of the big squares. As a bonus, the beautiful pedestrian and open shopping malls of Kärntner Strasse and Graben are just as close. The Stephansdom (St. Stephen's Cathedral) anchors both streets. For most travellers who rent apartments, supplies and provisions are very important. A short walk from the apartment is the beautiful Neue Markt and at one end of it stands Bila, a first class supermarket, which also sells prepared food of excellent quality. Then, at the end of Graben, one finds the famous Julius Meinl supermarket. All around, there are patisseries and cafes, including, at the Graben end of Dorotheergasse, at no. 6, the famous Kaffeehaus Hawelka, still looking as it looked in the days of its opening, in 1939. Two good Italian-style restaurants are at the corner of Dorotheergasse with Augustinerstrasse, but good Viennese goulash, noodle soup, three kinds of snitzel and not the least palacsintas can be had (should be had) at Cafe Palffy, next door to Palais Palffy on Josefplatz. They will even accommodate take-outs. The building at Dorotheergasse 22 is in excellent shape, with a modern elevator, small but still larger than most we have found in our travels. The building has a mixed of apartments and offices, and is very quiet at all hours. The apartment is located on the 1st floor European, 2nd floor North America. The apartment is well furnished, with a king-sized bed in the main bedroom, two single beds in the second bedroom and a sofa in the living/dining room. The dining room offers a table with four chairs and a number of sturdy folding chairs are available in the two bedrooms. The apartment was very clean. A bonus is the long corridor and the doors that allow privacy to the various rooms as desired. A good-size flat screen TV, cable TV, Wifi, were available in the living/dining room. In line with what we have seen lately elsewhere, there is no land line telephone in the apartment. Guests should rely on their own mobiles, or use unlocked mobiles with Austrian SIM cards.

The apartment was exactly how it looks in the picture. It has been mentioned before that there is no lift only stairs to apartment (for luggage) but a little exercise never hurt anyone Every little detail of our stay was catered for. Location wise the apartment is fantastic, literally 2 mins walk down the street are two supermarkets, less then 5 mins walk to main metro station and you will be in the city centre in under 10 minutes. For people attending conferences at Messe Wien, it is again a few minutes walk away. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking to travel to Vienna as a tourist or for work.

For people that go for work reasons is only two stations far from UNO city where all international organizations are located. For people that like sports-running the flat is next to the Prater (big park in Vienna) and 8 min walk from the Danube river. For tourists,the appartment is 10 min from the city center by Ubahn (U1). Also very close to a Fresh station, which is an amazing Turkish place that sells fresh fruit from all over the world. Finally is a 5 min walk from Prater that is a Ubahn and Tren station that opens a Billa supermarket from Monday to Sunday until 10 during the week. This is something that you do not have in Vienna (everything is closed on sundays) so is a plus.<br/><br/>The appartment is located in an old building but is well furnished with new stuff.

2298,242216,446748220,02-05-2019,29179534,Anna,"Я не могу разделить восторженных отзывов об этом жилье. Да, у квартиры есть достоинства: удобное расположение, тихий район, близость к метро, станция на прямой ветке с аэропортом и центром города. Удобный check-in через сейф с кодом. Инструкции присланы вовремя. Хороший Wi-Fi, достаточно розеток. Индивидуальная система обогрева. Но есть и недостатки. Во-первых, весьма слышно соседей в подъезде, т.к. входная дверь не обладает ни звуко, ни теплоизоляцией, от нее жутко дует. Во-вторых, микрокухня начинается прямо от входной двери, одновременно являясь и прихожей. Маленький слабенький холодильник с обледенелой морозилкой (расположен под духовкой). Убитая сковородка. Не все чашки были качественно промыты. Б/у губка для мытья посуды. В-третьих, спальня – это только кровать шириной 160см, удобная, мягкая. И все. Дверь и кровать. Ни крючка, ни стула. Обещанное место для хранения чемоданов под кроватью занято ведрами, тряпками и пылью. Весь размер этой комнаты – максимум 5 кв.м. В-четвертых, эта комната плохо шумоизолирована от ванной, а если в ванной еще включена и вентиляция, то уровень шума достигает 60дБ. Также шумно работает газовая колонка. В-пятых, в квартире нет запасов постельного белья и полотенец, даже под замком. Поэтому любое отклонение от правил, человеческий фактор вызывает проблемы. Выдается по одному большому и одному маленькому полотенцу на человека, полотенца для ног не предусмотрено. В-шестых, в квартире не слишком чисто. Одеяла и подушки без постельного белья лучше не видеть, пятна и разводы. Шторы в пятнах. Перед нами, видимо, жила какая-то суперволосатая женщина, так ее волосы были везде: на полотенцах, постельном белье, на коврике в ванной, в стиральной машине. Я хоть и убрала в стиральной машине, но стирать все-таки побрезговала. Случайно заглянула под диван, там слой пыли и старые чеки. Полотенцесушитель в ванной тоже весь пыльный. В-седьмых, есть явное несоответствие в описании. В разделе ""Правила дома"" вначале указано: ""Время прибытия — после 12:00, а выезд до 10:00"". А через абзац в разделе ""Прибытие и отъезд"" иная информация: ""Ваша квартира будет доступна с 15:00 не позднее, чем в день прибытия.

She met us upon our arrival to a spotless apartment and she gave directions to get there. I came from the airport and it was only one train ride away. <br/><br/>The airline lost my luggage on the way over and she was more than helpful when talking with the airport in German to ensure my bag made it to the apartment location with no troubles. Thanks again for that. <br/><br/>You'll have no troubles making yourself at home here. Kitchen is fully usable and the bedroom provides a great sleep. There's a TV and large living room to lounge in <br/><br/>Would highly recommend this unit for any first time traveller to Vienna. ,Comfortable city flat at Rennweg,1271221,Familien,Landstra§e,48.19148,16.39017,Entire home/apt,43,4,169,02-10-2021,1.38,2,282,11,en

2357,242287,3.98E+17,02-07-2021,234216896,Denys,"Similar to the review let by other guest, I have mixed feelings about this place.<br/><br/>- Check-in: Very easy to check-in. The instructions are sent ahead of time. The key is left in the key-box with the code downstairs. I give check-in 5*. <br/>- Cleanliness: it was not terrible, but it was not cleaned. There were some peanuts under the sofa, so you know that the host did not clean it well.<br/>- Bedroom: I would not even call it a room. It is probably 2,5m by 2m. There is only a bed in the room and it takes 90% of the space. You can approach the bed from one side only, as three other sides of the bed attached to walls. It feels claustrophobic. The room gets very hot and there is very little air flow. I would recommend to stay in a leaving room and sleep on a couch.<br/>- Blanket: the blanket is a kid's size. It is probably 1,5m by 0,75m - it is tiny. On a hot day, you probably would not care, but it is really uncomfortable. <br/>- Bathroom: the host did not provide neither shampoo nor shower-gel. So, plan to bring and buy one. The soap bottle was filled with water instead of soap. You will probably need to buy it as well.<br/>- WiFi: it was good. Not the fastest, but fast enough to watch YouTube or Netflix. You should not have any issues.<br/>- Washer: It works well. If you stay for several days and/or need to do laundry, you should have no problems to do it. The detergent is actually provided! Instead of shampoo, you get detergent. :)<br/>- Kitchen: no issues there. You get all basic items you may need.<br/>- Check-out: it was not a good experience.

We stayed here over the Christmas holiday. Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to meet her. We had just arrived in Vienna and were having issues with public transportation. She kindly left us a map to the keys, and with it a welcome letter. It explained the basics of the apartment.

Rather than repeat much of what has been stated before I intend to dwell on those that struck me the most.<br/>Corinna was always most helpful prior to our stay, no matter where she may have been at the time!<br/>Maschenka was our contact whilst in Vienna and proved to be a most charming young lady and only too ready to assist us with any queries or problems (of which there were very few).<br/>I noticed that the apartments heating was most efficient. It was rarely needed, whilst the apartment seemed to keep it's warmth most readily. Washing on the drying rack took very little time to dry.<br/>As has been stated several times the location of the apartment is super quiet, being at the end of a cul de sac. No passing traffic at all. There is an alley at at the end of the road that leads one quite safely to the roads leading to Westbahnhof.<br/>City public transport abounds nearby. We tried the Cycle Wien too:- easy to organise, in fact easier than trying to get used to the traffic rules and signs for cycling around the city!<br/>I loved the 80 sq m. space. We stayed for three whole weeks and I appreciated all that extra room; it makes it feel more like a home away from home than any smaller apartment could. <br/>As a location for a visit to Vienna then I would imagine that it would be hard to better; more or less halfway between Schonnbrunn Park and the heart of the city. A brisk 20 minute walk will take one to either. Mariahilfer Strasse, at it's closest point only 5 minutes walk away, was a favourite for us with it's shops and cafes galore! <br/>To sum up I have no hesitation in recommending this lovely second floor apartment.","Your beautiful, central& sunny home",1280331,Corinna & Team,Mariahilf,48.19214,16.34293,Entire home/apt,85,2,150,26-07-2021,1.24,2,344,3,en

2459,252052,11493733,05-04-2014,13186205,Aiman,"We stayed at Ingela's apartment in the beginning of April with 3 children ages 11, 8 and 5 mos. Ingela was very friendly and helpful. <br/>The apartment was cold at first but we adjusted the AC and it became ok. However, I would recommend some slippers or warm socks as the apartment is on the ground floor. <br/>Kitchen - there was everything that you need for cooking (utensils, pots, etc) as well as some basic like salt, sugar, teabags. Nice stove and microwave. <br/>Living room - very cozy, also served us as a dining room. Comfortable sofa, armchair. We didn't really watch TV but there is something with the volume - even on the max it was like min. But Ingela has DVDs so the kids watched a few and the volume worked fine in that case. <br/>Unfortunately, we didn't get to enjoy the terrace due to the chilly weather, but children did go out once to play ""who-blows-out-all-the-candles-at-once"" game =) <br/>2nd Bedroom - limited space but enough for sleeping, however, the closets are quite spacious. Children enjoyed playing on the bunk beds - creating some kind of a club/tent. <br/>Master bedroom - spacious, light, very roomy closets. The mattress is too soft for my liking but generally serves its purpose. The blinds can be shaded which is nice for sensitive sleepers. We used the bunk bed for our baby instead of the crib, as with the crib you needed to bend down to put the baby in, which is tricky in my case as I always tend to wake him up. So we brought our own mini-mattress with sides (not sure what it's called). <br/>Bathroom - I liked the washer/dryer the most as we had to do laundry for our kids. Otherwise, nothing special. The good feature is that the toilet is separated. Location - very central! On the map it looked like a lot of walking to the central Vienna, but upon arrival I realized it's easier to walk rather than use underground (the closest Ubahn is 2-3 mins away, or there's another Line 5 mins away). We walked to MariaHilf, StephanPlatz, etc. Even with 3 kids I was able to get around very easily and relatively fast. <br/>Unfortunately, there is no supermarket very close, so we had to walk a little, especially to find diapers which for some reason were only sold at DM (cosmetic store). <br/>There is a Citybike station very nearby as well for those who want to take a bike-tour instead of walking. If you return the bike within an hour, it's free of charge, then you can take another bike right away. <br/>Note: there is a little staircase for those who will be visiting with the strollers, not too bad but tricky. Oh and to turn on the light in the corridor you need to press the red little round button (we couldn't figure it out at first and ended up ringing the neighbor's door as it looked like a standard light switch).",City Centre with Garden!

Judith is a phenomenal host -- energetic, engaged, service-oriented, friendly, fun, and knowledgeable about her city -- but at the same time discrete and very respectful of her tenants. Leopoldstadt, Vienna's second district where Judith's apartments are located, is Vienna's up-and-coming neighbourhood, a bit like Brooklyn ten years ago -- traditionally a Jewish community but now gentrifying with fantastic old building stock, large green spaces, a canal and a river, an emerging community of artists, expats, and adventurous locals, and a bourgeoning cultural scene (and the food is top notch here, whether it be traditional Viennese, fine dining, food from the Far East, the Balkans or the Middle East). Judith's building is right on top of an U-bahn station and a major tram line so getting anywhere in the city is a breeze but at the same time, it's quiet and peaceful while being very close to the city centre (five minutes away by public transit and maybe a ten-minute commute on foot). The apartment is bright and spacious with high ceilings, tastefully appointed, and fully furnished with a huge bathroom and very comfortable queen-sized bed. There is also a small but very well stocked kitchen and a desk area for work. The weekly linen and towel change that Judith offers is a real treat and the twenty-four hour access to the laundry and cleaning room right across the corridor from the apartment is so convenient. If I ever move back to Vienna, I will only stay at Judith's place! All in all, nothing but the highest compliments!

They are friendly and personable, provide recommendations for local events, can make dinner or taxi reservations on your behalf, clean around your schedule, and are completely respectful of your privacy.  They never hovered, yet any inquiry I sent via email was always responded to quickly and efficiently.  Absolute professionals.<br/><br/>The space provides plenty of storage and amenities, including a kitchen, wonderfully large bathroom (no showering in the toilet here, thank you), wifi and tv, and a great view of the Vienna rooftops and cathedral steeples from either apartment.  I have so many great sunset pictures taken from my room!  <br/><br/>You only have one neighbor, if at all.  Laundry facilities are 3 feet from your door.  There is an elevator to make hauling tons of luggage or groceries a breeze. And it's located directly on top of the U2 subway station, and a tram and bus hub, getting you where ever you need to go in the city in minutes.  I used to just walk to Stephensplatz because it was an absolutely beautiful 20 minute walk, but when I was feeling lazy, transport got me there in 10.  This location was crazy central without the pricetag.<br/><br/>Within one block you have multiple grocery stores, beauty supply stores, banks, bakeries, restaurants, cafes and bars.  Walk to the nearby park, or to the Prater for a rollercoaster ride, or to the gorgeous Danube canal, or just wander around all the tiny side streets full of gorgeous Viennese architecture.  <br/><br/>The neighborhood is predominantly Jewish with it's own fantastic, unique cultural traditions; and is super family-oriented and therefore extremely safe.

It is also within 10 minutes walking distance from a hip area of restaurants and bars along the Danube Canal (heading towards the city centre). <br/><br/>Vienna as a city is beautiful - possessing a rich political history, ornate state buildings and fantastic cuisine. I would recommend to anyone travelling to Vienna to see a famous concert, and to visit the Maria Theresa monument as well as the Arsenal (Museum of Military History).

It is in a quiet, safe neighborhood of families, lots of kids and people walking dogs, but close to transit lines that made it easy and fast to get anywhere in the city. Many grocery stores are located nearby, within easy walking distance. Lidl is just 2 blocks away and had most of the essentials, but seemed to be a bit hit or miss depending on when I visited. Merkur was a little further away but had a more complete selection. The kitchen was fully equipped and I cooked many meals. The TV and internet setup was flawless, the  bed was very comfortable, and the bath and shower were spacious and well stocked with necessary items. When I arrived 4 hours before check in, Bernd was gracious in allowing me to store my luggage in the apartment while it was being cleaned. There was a chair in the living room that was broken and unusable, but Bernd was quick to replace it with a new one when I let him know. He visited with me to welcome me to Vienna, and graciously spent nearly an hour talking with me and discussing this amazing city. On Bernd's recommendation I visited s'Schmankerl-Eck about 3 blocks away, and the food was excellent and reasonably priced. Also visited Pizzeria Madera about 4 blocks away, and it was outstanding. Also recommended - Gasthaus Kopp, a short U6 ride north (Jagerstrabe 2 stops to Handelskai, then a 3 block walk), that had the best wiener schnitzel I have ever had. More schnitzel than I could eat and 2 glasses of wine were $17, cash only. Very homey and comfortable. Getting to and from the airport was quick and easy. Take to S7 train from the airport to Handelskai, then the U6 from Handelskai to Jagerstabe, then a 4 or 5 block walk.<br/><br/>There is also a laundry in the basement of the building that was easy to use.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this apartment enough, and would happily stay here when I visit Vienna again.",City Apartment at the Danube Canal,1510847,Katerina,Brigittenau,48.23429,16.36409,Entire home/apt,48,2,259,22-11-2021,2.22,3,334,11,en

The apartment is really well equiped and the heating is great, which is a good thing in during the cold winter months! I didn't get to meet Dan in person but he was always very reactive whenever I needed something. When there was a problem with the stove, he sent someone very quicly to have it replaced (and now there is a brand new induction cooktop). The only issue might be that the  neighbours can be quite loud at times, but only during the day, so I've never had any trouble to sleep. Speaking of, the bedding is comfortable and the beds are reclining, which I really liked. There is no elevator but the stairs are not steep at all so I was never tired climbing them.

He showed us around the apartment and was really helpful with telling us how to catch the tram in to town. The apartment was extremely clean and really cosy. It's nicely decorated and has a  comfortable bed. The apartment is either a 25 minute walk to the opera or a 10 min tram ride which was very easy. We had a lovely time and a great time in the apartment. We hope to get back to Vienna again over the next couple of years. ,SUITE - 10 hotspots in 10 minutes,1100216,Belinda,Margareten,48.18461,16.35976,Entire home/apt,40,5,260,20-10-2021,2.17,2,120,5,en

Although we always like to try different things, we would definitely have to consider Belinda's apartment when back to this beautiful city.<br/><br/>Arriving from Budapest by train we departed at Wien-Meidling station. getting out of the train station to the left was a ticket office and we bought a week pass for all transportation in Vienna. Then we took tram 62 (or Bahn, both have almost similar route) and we got off at Laurenzgasse station. This station is 100 meters from Belinda's appartment. From Laurenzgasse it is 3-4 stops to the Opera House, the center of Vienna. Stop there and start walking, that's all you need to do to explore Vienna's best.<br/><br/>The apartment is VERY clean and very nicely put together. The bed is very comfortable. Being on the third floor (they count it as second floor) and on a very small side street, noise is at minimum and sleep comes easy.<br/><br/>The shower is powerful and hot water was ready at all times. The kitchen is tiny but really has all you will need like a coffee makes, a kettle, a toaster and a microwave.<br/><br/>A huge Grocery store EuroSpar is 5 minutes walk on Kliebergasse (turn left at the end of Jahngasse). A convenient store, a bakery and three very good restaurants are  3 minutes walk on the main road just on your way to the tram station Laurenzgasse.<br/><br/>Everything is around you and Vienna's Ring is 10 minutes away on the tram.<br/><br/>We never met Belinda but her husband showed us around. They had a great selection of maps and mini guides for the city, a great thing to have when you want to explore a city.<br/><br/>The only inconvenience was the fact that the washing machine is in the basement and the basement is not the most inviting (to say the least). The machine operates on coins and Belinda had them ready for us. However, we never used it.<br/><br/>All in all a great place.",SUITE - 10 hotspots in 10 minutes,1100216,Belinda,Margareten,48.18461,16.35976,Entire home/apt,40,5,260,20-10-2021,2.17,2,120,5,en

The location is great since its just 5 min walk from the Metro line (1 and 62) which take you downtown. My girlfriend and I really loved our stay in Vienna and when we get a chance to go back will definately book this place again. Belinda and her husband were great and allowed us to keep the luggage in the apartment since we had a late flight and also booked the cab for us. This is what I call a great service.

Belinda's place is very well-located, not too far out of the city center and within very reasonable walking distance of major city and regional transport options. There's not a lot of street/restaurant life in the immediate vicinity, but it's all a fairly short walk away. If the weather were a bit warmer--we were there in late November--those walks to and from transport might even have been pleasant! :o)<br/><br/>The apartment itself is compact and well appointed with comfortable beds. The limited kitchen is great for the basics. <br/><br/>All in all, a good experience!",SUITE - 10 hotspots in 10 minutes,1100216,Belinda,Margareten,48.18461,16.35976,Entire home/apt,40,5,260,20-10-2021,2.17,2,120,5,en

2992,293667,13736039,03-06-2014,1731350,Sarah,"Our experience with Belinda was pleasant from beginning to end. Due to her own travel plans, she had someone else meet us at the apartment so we never actually met her or her husband but her email support was quick and thorough. The apartment was just as pictured. It was a perfect size for two people and might also work well for one or two more who want to share. The kitchenette is small but adequate. We made breakfast and had snacks but could have prepared a bigger meal if we had wanted to. Best of all is the location, a high priority for us. Just one block off the main street, her street is so quiet. About 3 blocks away is public transportation that will take you to the tourist area in just a few short minutes. The ride to the main train station for regional trains was perhaps 15 minutes. The ride to the special train that takes you to the airport was maybe 10 minutes away though that train takes 30 minutes. We chose to do that rather than take a taxi. There are 3 supermarkets and several restaurants within two blocks. I also highly recommend the Wortner Cafe which was 2 tram stops away at Mayerhofgasse.

They make sure you are all set up before they leave you and answer all your questions. Everything you need for a short or long stay is available. The metro stop is less than a 10 minute walk and it takes about 10 minutes to get to the downtown area. Which is nice because you do enough walking as it is, save your feet for a few minutes.

Единственный минус для нас, т.к. мы были с ребёнком, вечером и ночью в квартире было прохладно, примерно, 21-22С. Возможно, все жители дома выставляли температуру по максимуму, поэтому на всех тепла не хватало.  Эта тема актуальна только в зимний период. До остановки трамвая очень близко, мы засекали, с ребёнком 4-5 минут спокойным шагом, до Карлплац (до центра) 10 минут. По этой же ветке ходит трамвай до Бадена (бело-синий). Помимо самого Бадена, который стоит посетить, на этой линии находится музей Шоколада и детский игровой центр Bogi Park. Район – спальный, квартал тихий, рядом несколько супермаркетов. Хозяйка может заказать вам такси, что очень удобно. При заселении проверяйте электроприборы )) мы два дня кипятили воду для чая в ковшике, т.к. не работал электрический чайник. Мы попали в период рождественских каникул с 24 на 25 декабря, и хозяева отдыхали, поэтому мы без претензий )) В-общем, квартиру рекомендуем,  чистая и удобная, но на короткий период проживания, т.к. по своим габаритам кухня только для приготовления завтрака и чая (двухкомфорочная плита). Стиральная машинка располагается в “живописном” подвале и запускается не с первого раза. Хотя если вы останавливаетесь на несколько дней это не актуально.
